# Reporting Security Issues

Please email any issues that you feel affect the security for users to jessiefrance.report@gmail.com. I will do my best to respond within a few days. If possible, it would be helpful (but not necesssary) if you provide any examples, relevant code, or even a possible fix to the security issue.

**Please do not publish your security report** until I've had a chance to look at it. I'd like to be afforded a chance to repair any security vulnerabilities that may affect users before you make the security vulnerability known to the public.

For non-security issues, please just file a regular report on the GitHub issue tracker, but if you're unsure, then please feel free to send an email.
